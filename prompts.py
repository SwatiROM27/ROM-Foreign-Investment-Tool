This indicates if the company already has a decent size that would allow international expansion. 
For example, company with the following revenue details- ;;;;;;;;;300;; means 300M EUR revenue in 2024. Blank and semicolon indictaes no revenue for that year. 

- Revenue growth: Revnue growth can indicate a positive signal that the company is ready for new target markets

- Employees lates number: We usually target companies that have 15 employees or more 

- Employee growth: If the number of employees is declining this is usually a negative signal regarding international expansion

- Launch Year: We usually target companies that are at minimum 3 years old

- Company status: If the status is ‘acquired’ search for information about the acquisition online. Take this information into consideration in the analysis and include this in the output. 

- Total Funding: The fact that a company has raised funding is a positive signal indicating (international) growth ambitions. The bigger the amount the more positive

- Last funding date: Funding within the last 2 years is the most relevant, since the money will be still available to spend

- Last round: Typically pre-seed an seed rounds are used for product development and series A B and C are used for international expansion

- Last funding amount: The fact that a company has raised funding is a positive signal indication (international) growth ambitions. The bigger the amount the more positive

- HQ Country: We are more interested in companies from developed countries and emerging markets 

- Other office locations: This information is interpreted different for each sector. If this information is relevant this is explained in the industry specific signals. 

- Number of patents: If the company has a patent or a number of patens this indicated that the company is innovative, this is a positive signal since we target innovative companies.  
If the company is non-European but does have European patents this can be a signal that they are exploring European expansion.

- LinkedIn: You can use this LinkedIn URL as a source to find how many employees they have and in which locations. Companies that have no entity in the Netherlands but do have employees that are based in the Netherlands are especially interesting. 
Also partnerships, clients and investment rounds can be announced at the LinkedIn page.

- In Achilles: This shows if the company is already in our CRM (our CRM is named Achilles). This is a positive signal that makes the company more relevant. 

- In NL? : This shows if the company has a Dutch location that is mentioned in our CRM system Achilles. Always double check on the company website where they have office locations. 

- Provinces and Employees: This shows in which provinces the Dutch entity is located. Companies in Utrecht Region are especially interesting for ROM Utrecht Region. 

- Last projects: This is extremely relevant and shows if there have been a project with this company where we assisted them in their expansion to the Netherlands. 
 If there is an project with the status ‘on hold’ or ‘active’ this is a positive signal. If there is a project with the status ‘cancelled’ or ‘lost’ this is not a negative signal. If there is a project with the status ‘completed’, ‘confirmed’ or ‘not involved’ this means the company has (had) a Dutch entity. In this case mention this in the output. 

- Project Teams: If Utrecht Region was part of the project teams this is a positive signal, since it means the company is familiar with Utrecht Region and was interested in working with us in the past.

 3. **CRITICAL SCORING RULES - CHECK FIRST**: Before any other analysis, check the company's website and following input columns: HQ country, HQ city, Other office locations, Provinces and Employees, In NL?, and Company Name (look for "BV" which indicates Dutch entity)
   
      **SCORING RULES for GPT Score column (MANDATORY):**
   
       **IMPORTANT**: You MUST check for Dutch presence FIRST before doing any other analysis. Follow this EXACT sequence:
    
    **STEP 1: Check for Utrecht Region presence FIRST**
    a. **Score 0 - Already in Utrecht Region**: If the company has an office in Utrecht region municipalities 
    (Amersfoort, Baarn, de Bilt, Bilthoven, Bunnik, Bunschoten, Eemnes, Houten, IJsselstein, Leusden, Lopik, 
    Montfoort, Nieuwegein, Oudewater, Renswoude, Rhenen, de Ronde Vennen, Soest, Soesterberg, Stichtse Vecht, 
    Utrecht, de Meern, Utrechtse Heuvelrug, Veenendaal, Vijfheerenlanden, Wijk bij Duurstede, Woerden, 
    Woudenberg, Zeist, Hilversum, Gooise Meren, Blaricum, Huizen, Laren), assign **score 0** and write **"Already in Utrecht Region: [Municipality Name]"** in "Score Explanation"
       - Treat "HQ city" field listing a city in Utrecht Region as PRIMARY evidence
       - Treat the "company's Website" → Locations/Contact page listing an address in Utrecht Region as PRIMARY evidence (cite page and date)

    **EXAMPLE**: If "HQ City" = "Hilversum" assign **GPT Score: 0**, abnd write **Already in Utrecht Region: HQ city shows Hilversum** in the "Score Explanation" column   
    
    **STEP 2: If NOT in Utrecht Region, check for Netherlands presence**
    b. **Score 0 - Already in Netherlands**: ONLY if you find CONCRETE evidence of Dutch presence (but NOT in Utrecht Region):
      - Company name contains Dutch legal entity (BV, NV, etc.)
      - Website shows Dutch office address (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, etc.)
      - Company explicitly states "Netherlands office" or "Dutch entity"
      - Input data shows "In NL? = Yes" or Dutch provinces in "Provinces and Employees"
             - "Other office locations" field lists EXACT country/city evidence for the Netherlands: country equals "Netherlands"/"Nederland"/standalone "NL", or specific Dutch cities like Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, Eindhoven, Tilburg, Groningen, Breda, Nijmegen, Enschede, Apeldoorn, Haarlem, Almere, Arnhem, Maastricht, Leiden, Delft, Zwolle (EXCLUDING Utrecht Region municipalities listed above)
       - Website → Locations/Contact page lists a Dutch address (cite page and date)
       
        **CRITICAL**: If "Other office locations" contains ONLY the country name ("Netherlands", "Nederland" or standalone token "NL"), this is SUFFICIENT evidence to assign Score 0
       
       **IMPORTANT - DO NOT COUNT AS NETHERLANDS**: Region/continent terms such as "Europe", "EU", "EMEA", "Benelux", "BeNeLux", "Western Europe", "Northern Europe", "Scandinavia" MUST NOT trigger Score 0
       
       **VALIDATION RULE**: "NL" must be a standalone token (e.g., ", NL" or " NL ") and not part of another word (e.g., "NLP"). Do not infer NL from phrases like "European office".
       
       **EXAMPLE**: If **Other office locations** = **Netherlands** → assign **score 0** and write **"Already in Netherlands: Other office locations shows Netherlands"** in "Score Explanation"     
      
      **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT assume presence just because they have a Dutch website (.nl) or mention EU countries
  
  c. **Score 0-100 - Potential for New Investment**: Only for companies NOT in Netherlands or Utrecht region, generate a score (0-100) indicating likelihood of establishing new 
  business entity in Netherlands within 12 months. Analyze the "GPT score" based on the all the columns that are present in the csv and also by analyzing the 
  signals (generic and sector specific) used to analyze the "Analyzed Sector" column for each company. In "Score Explanation" column, explain why (max 40 words).
  
     **Examples of Score 0 explanations:**
   - "Already in Netherlands: Office in Hilversum (website)"
   - "Already in Netherlands: Dutch entity BV in company name"
   - "Already in Netherlands: LinkedIn shows 5 employees in Amsterdam"
   - "Already in Utrecht Region: Utrecht"
   - "Already in Utrecht Region: Amersfoort"
   - "Already in Netherlands: In NL? = Yes in data"
   
       **REMINDER**: Follow the EXACT sequence: 
    1. Check Utrecht Region FIRST - if found, assign Score 0 and stop
    2. If NOT in Utrecht Region, check Netherlands - if found, assign Score 0 and stop  
    3. Only proceed with scoring 1-100 if company is NOT in Netherlands or Utrecht Region  

4. In "GPT Dutch Ecosystem Fit & Chain Partners" column, provide SPECIFIC Dutch ecosystem connections and potential chain partners (max. 40 words). Focus on:
   - Specific Dutch companies they could partner with
   - Specific Dutch research institutes they could collaborate with
   - Specific Dutch government programs they could benefit from
   - Specific Dutch market needs they could address
   
   A good example: "Could partner with TNO on circular economy projects, aligns with PortXL accelerator program, addresses Dutch construction sector's sustainability goals."  

5. Use Browsing  to find up-to-date external information (company website, news articles, LinkedIn, data bases with investment and funding information, databases for patents,  EU plans, etc.). 
Prioritize primary sources, i.e., sources mentioned in the siganls used to analyze the sector for each company. News articles should be no more than two years old. Use multiple sources online available for this company.
 Give a reasoning in a separate column "GPT Source". Only include sources that provide SPECIFIC, ACTIONABLE information that helps decide whether to approach the company. 

    IMPORTANT RULES:
